# 🍷 Wine Quality Data Analysis

## Overview

This project focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a wine quality dataset. The dataset contains various physicochemical properties of wine, along with a quality rating (ranging from 0 to 10). The goal is to explore and analyze the dataset to uncover patterns and insights that influence wine quality. This repository showcases the steps taken, visualizations, and conclusions drawn from the analysis.

## Dataset Description

The dataset used in this project consists of physicochemical properties of white wines, such as:

- `fixed acidity`
- `volatile acidity`
- `citric acid`
- `residual sugar`
- `chlorides`
- `free sulfur dioxide`
- `total sulfur dioxide`
- `density`
- `pH`
- `sulphates`
- `alcohol`
- `quality` (target variable)

The data is stored in a **CSV** file where each row represents a unique wine sample.
