# üç∑ Wine Quality Data Analysis

## Overview

This project focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a wine quality dataset. The dataset contains various physicochemical properties of wine, along with a quality rating (ranging from 3 to 9). The goal is to explore and analyze the dataset to uncover patterns and insights that influence wine quality. This repository showcases the steps taken & visualizations.
